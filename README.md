# The Hollows Engine [Highly Experimental]
A different take on Game Engines, pushing the "Next Gen" of engine design while learning from the existing systems.

### Currently in progress:
- Indexed Spatial Rendering (render pixels directly from a pre-sorted vertex list, sorted by coordinates in world space, no rasterization)

### Initial Roadmap:
- LiCap Framework (see below)
- Indexed Spatial cacluations (alternative to RT, to calculate reflections and light bounces, based on the sorted list)
- Live Defferred Editing (a framework for utilizing external apps like Blender and Cascadeur right inside the endgine, maps a basic visual interface when needed [Cas's control points] and forwards all the keyboard shortcuts to the relevant software, retrieves the output and applies)
- Curve-Based Neuro Motion (An animation system that makes the body follow a line of action set by the animator, while accounting for body physics and neuroligical response, is supposed to utilize Cas's auto posing to map the body to its curves)

This is the implementation project for the HotWireNine (LiCap FrameWork] Prototype here: https://github.com/ViZeon/licap-framework
