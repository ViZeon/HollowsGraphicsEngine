# Archived Organization & Review Policy
- Regularly check chat history for new or updated instructions.
- Refactor instruction files to keep them organized and avoid excessive sections.
- Group instructions by logical category (e.g., Naming, Task Management, Backup, Research, Workflow).
- Always add new instructions to the correct section/file, merging with existing content when possible.
- Only create new sections/files when truly necessary for clarity or separation.
- ALWAYS add every new instruction, workflow rule, or naming/task management policy to the correct file immediately.
