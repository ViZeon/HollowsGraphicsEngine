# Copilot Instructions

## Naming
- Favor cool, self-explanatory names for folders and files (e.g., Sandbox, Playground, Portal, etc.).

## Task Management
- Use the `AI/toDo` folder for task management.
- Create one file per task chain (related sequence of actions).
- Rename files by priority to keep the most important tasks visible.
- Update or archive completed chains for clarity.

## Backup
- Always create a backup of relevant files or project state before making any changes.
- Store backups in the `AI/backups` folder with clear timestamps or descriptions.
- Restore from backup if needed after any unintended change or error.

## Research & Best Practices
- Search online for existing tutorials, guides, or community solutions that closely match the project’s purpose.
- Prioritize approaches that are proven and widely used, especially those with positive feedback or adoption in similar projects.
- Follow these guides instead of guessing or relying solely on API documentation.
- Always double-check solutions for reliability and fit with project requirements.
- Document sources and reasoning in the AI folder when relevant.

## Workflow
- Keep workspace clean and uncluttered.
- Prefer minimal, modular changes over large rewrites.
- Record all decisions and requirements in the `AI` folder.
- Use Markdown for documentation and instructions.
- When in doubt, ask for clarification before making major changes.
- Prioritize user’s stated design philosophy and workflow.
- Automate repetitive tasks when possible, but confirm before bulk actions.
- Keep all context and logs up to date for easy reference.
- Before tackling any task, review the chat history and both AI instruction files for relevant context and decisions.
- Regularly update instruction files with new insights, requirements, or decisions from the chat.
- If unsure about how to proceed, ask the user for clarification before making changes.
- Treat this as a standing instruction for all future work.

## Organization & Review Policy
- Regularly check chat history for new or updated instructions.
- Refactor instruction files to keep them organized and avoid excessive sections.
- Group instructions by logical category (e.g., Naming, Task Management, Backup, Research, Workflow).
- Always add new instructions to the correct section, merging with existing content when possible.
- Only create new sections when truly necessary for clarity or separation.
- ALWAYS add every new instruction, workflow rule, or naming/task management policy to the correct section immediately.
